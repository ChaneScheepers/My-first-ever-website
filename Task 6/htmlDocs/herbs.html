      See below a list of a few herbs used in cooking. My personal favourite is
      using sage. I fry the sage in butter and nuts.

          Thyme is a versatile herb with an earthy flavor. You'll find it in
          many major world cuisines, including Mediterranean, French, Middle
          Eastern, and Italian. Thyme can be used fresh or dried, and works well
          in soups, roasted vegetables, pasta, sauces, pizzas and more!

          The taste is fragrant, spicy, warm, astringent and a little bitter. It
          is used for flavouring meat and fish dishes and for poultry stuffing.
          Fresh sage leaves are used in salads and sandwiches

          mashed or baked potatoes, fish, seafood dishes and omelets

          Tarragon is commonly known as a flavoring for vinegar and is used in
          pickles, relishes, prepared mustards, and sauces. Tarragon also goes
          well with fish, meat, soups and stews, and is often used in tomato and
          egg dishes.

        <h2>Basil</h2>
        <img src="../Images/Basil.jpeg" alt="Basil" />
        <p>
          Basil is an herb in the mint family that is essential in Italian
          cooking, although it is also used in a variety of other types of
          cuisines including Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.

        <h2>Rosemary</h2>
        <img src="../Images/Rosemary.jpeg" alt="Rosemary" />
        <p>
          Studies have shown that the carnosic and rosmarinic acids in rosemary
          have powerful antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties.
          Consuming rosemary regularly can potentially help lower the risk of
          infection and help the immune system fight any infections that do
          occur
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 menu">
        <h2>Mint</h2>
        <img src="../Images/Mint.jpeg" alt="Mint" />
        <p>
          There are two major types of mint: spearmint and peppermint. Spearmint
          is most often used in cooking, while peppermint is preferred for
          flavoring sweets and breath fresheners. Our Spice IslandsÂ® spearmint
          is sourced from Egypt and has a cool, mellow aroma and flavor.
